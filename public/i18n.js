// i18n runtime for Emoji Blaster.
//
// English-only for now -- there's no language switcher in this game yet.
// I18N_STRINGS.en is the single source of truth for every piece of UI text;
// more languages get added as new blocks here (I18N_STRINGS.es, etc.) once
// translations come back. The clean key -> English export handed off for
// translation lives at ../i18n-source/en.json (repo root, outside public/,
// so it's never part of what actually gets deployed) -- keep that file's
// keys in sync with this one. Mirrors emoji-survey-scramble's and
// emoji-munchers' identical i18n.js -- same shape everywhere on purpose, so
// a translator (or future dev) never has to re-learn the pattern per repo.
//
// t(key, vars) looks up a string and fills in any {placeholder} tokens
// (e.g. t('lobby_status_waiting_min', { min: 2 })). Falls back to the raw
// key if it's ever missing, so a typo shows up as visibly broken text
// instead of silently rendering nothing.
//
// Resolved per-call (not a fixed top-level const) so it reflects whatever
// interface language the QMoji 2.0 homescreen actually launched this game
// with (?uiLang=), read directly from the URL rather than waiting on
// arcade-client.js's async initArcade() -- checking the URL synchronously
// here means the very first render already picks the right language.
