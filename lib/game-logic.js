// lib/game-logic.js — pure game rules, ported from the original server.js.
//
// These functions mutate the plain JSON room object passed in and return
// the Pusher event(s) that resulted, instead of mutating an in-memory
// object and calling io.to(code).emit(...) directly. The calling /api
// handler is responsible for persisting the mutated room to KV and
// publishing the returned events.
//
// A correct guess that completes a round used to spawn the next emoji after
// a 700ms pause (setTimeout) so players could read the "got it!" message.
// There's no persistent process to hold that timer anymore, so
// handleSyncGuess returns { immediateEvents, delayedEvent } — the caller
// publishes immediateEvents right away, awaits ~700ms, then publishes
// delayedEvent. The room mutation for the next round happens synchronously
// either way, so KV always reflects the true current state.
//
// Two cooperative modes, both built on the same consensus mechanic (players
// type freely, no locking in, a round clears once enough distinct players
// have independently typed the same word):
//   "sync"   — one emoji falls, target keywords are its own list.
//   "double" — two emojis fall together, target keywords are only the ones
//              they share, so the room has to find a word that fits both.
// There used to be a "Race" mode (first correct guess wins) with three
// difficulty levels; both were removed as a product decision.
